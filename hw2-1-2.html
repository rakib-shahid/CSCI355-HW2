    <h1>Revelation</h1>
    <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

    <p>
      We make ourselves a place apart
      <br />
      &nbsp;Behind light words that tease and flout,
      <br />
      But oh, the agitated heart
      <br />
      &nbsp;Till someone find us really out.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      'Tis pity if the case require
      <br />
      &nbsp;(Or so we say) that in the end
      <br />
      We speak the literal to inspire
      <br />
      &nbsp;The understanding of a friend.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      But so with all, from babes that play
      <br />
      &nbsp;At hide-and-seek to God afar,
      <br />
      So all who hide too well away
      <br />
      &nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.
      <br />
    </p>
